            "*   **Air Frying:** Many items can be air-fried without oil, relying on the circulating hot air.\n",
            "*   **Flavor Boosters:** Don't shy away from herbs, spices, garlic, onions, ginger, citrus juices, vinegars, nutritional yeast (for cheesy flavor), and miso paste (for umami) to add depth and excitement to your dishes.\n",
